500,"Mike,

I just don’t think I’m going to be able to work with you after everything that has happened.  I feel that it is difficult to work with a man that I dated, even if just briefly, particularly if you feel that you don’t want to date me.  I need this job.  You know my situation.  I’m kindly asking you to reconsider working together.  Please talk to me about this when you can.  I may just have to talk to our supervisor. 

Thank you,

Tammy

500,"Dear Camille,

Please refrain from discussing details of your dating life with co-workers. I overheard you the other day, and whew, it was pretty hot.  A little much for this old man to hear!

500,"Hey Chuck,

Samantha and I were looking over your portfolio and I wanted to talk to you about some of your work.  Would you like to get together for a drink and talk about your interests...and mine!

Saludos,

Christine"
500,"Hi Fred,

You looked great the other day!  Your weight loss has really helped you.  Would you want to go get a drink and talk after work?  If that is not your thing, let me know, but I just thought I’d venture out and tell you how good you’re looking!  Girls are going crazy.  They’re talking about you all the time at the front desk.

Priscilla"
500,"Hey Barry,

I liked what you were saying yesterday about the new girl.  You’re right.  She is hot!  You should go over there and talk to her.  Be sure to wear your tight jeans.  I’m sure she’ll like what you’ve got to offer ;)

501,"Dear Jim,

I was recently informed that you are considering Marco for the position of Maintenance Supervisor.  I am concerned that Marco may have a language barrier that will contribute to difficulty in communicating needs to employees.  Marco is from Mexico.  While his English is pretty good, I think he may have trouble expressing instructions to employees who don’t speak Spanish.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,

Sue

501," Hi everyone,

After this round of interviews, I want to express my concern over Mohammed Ahman.  While he may be very qualified, my fear is that, because he is Muslim, other co-workers may feel uncomfortable.  The majority of the sales team is Christian and certainly not comfortable regarding the Muslim faith.

Can we get together tomorrow at some point to discuss my concerns?

Thanks,

Shannon

We have two internal candidates for the Operations Specialist position.  First, there’s Angel.  He’s highly qualified and has a great background.  Then, there’s Stephanie too.  She’s qualified too.  I know this isn’t PC to say, but I don’t know how good it would be to have a woman in this position.  Please don’t get me wrong.  She’s great to work with.  The crew all loves her, but I don’t think she’s assertive enough to be the Specialist.  So, that’s my feedback.  I thought it might help in making this decision.

Kind regards,

Dean

501,"Dear Joe,

I was looking through the applications for the analyst position.  I think it is safe to say that any of the guys from China need to be removed from the list of interviewees.  We know what happened with Zhou when we hired him.  It was the worst decision we ever made!  

Do you want to meet tomorrow to discuss?

Thanks,

John

501,"Susan,

Thank you for your application for the position of machinist.  At this point, we are reviewing your candidacy, particularly because you are an internal applicant; however, the position requires the ability to lift heavy objects and work with the machining crew (all men).  I just want to warn you that it’s not an easy environment to work in.  Also, I know you have children, and sometimes we have to work extra long hours to  get products out. I’m only telling you this so you know what you’re getting into.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Steve

502,"Yo Tom,

What the hell happened in that stupid meeting?  That f**ker really let us have it!  We really don’t deserve that.  He’s such an asshole!  I’m pretty sure he’s a fag who is taking it out on us!!

See you tomorrow,
Seth

502,"Hi Frank,

I had a really good time at the work party yesterday.  I wanted to pass this joke along to you :)  From one divorced guy to another…

A married couple down on their luck decides to make a few extra bucks by reluctantly having the wife work the corner. After the first day the husband picks her up and asks ""how did you do?"". She says, ""I did pretty well, I made $200.50"". He asks, ""What asshole gave you 50 cents?"" and she replies ""all of them"".

They’re all hoes!!

502," Fred,

I’m attaching the minutes from our safety meeting.  We had a lot to cover and I think you did a great job at getting those African engineers on track.  Boy, they don’t teach them anything about safety, I swear!

I can’t stand working with the new guys from Africa.  It’s driving me crazy!!  F**kin’ idiots!  They don’t even understand what I’m saying when I talk to them.

They need to go back home or they’re going to kill us with their lack of safety practices!

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,

Jim

502,"Hey Joe and Jeff,

I had a great time last night at the bar.  Next time, let’s avoid the f**kin’ bar with the ragheads though.  They’ll probably kill us if we’re not careful….don’t wanna drink around those guys again.  LOL!

502,"Hey Cindy, what in god’s name is upper management trying to do? This is such a bunch of fucking assholes

503,"Rumors are going around again that there will be layoffs in the near future. Whomever started the rumor, we will find out who you are and you will be subject to disciplinary action. Whether or not the rumor is true, until there are announcements to the entire staff, management information is confidential. Please contact HR if you know who is discussing this private matter. Thank you."
503,"There will be no further discussions about potential raises/bonuses. If you are offered a raise or bonus, you are not to discuss it with your coworkers. That information is confidential."
503,"Duh, why do you think I wanted to work in payroll? I know what everybody makes! Wouldn’t you like to?"
503,"Where does she get the money for something like that? I know what she makes, and trust me, it’s not enough!"
503,David told me his bonus was more than mine. I’m going to John right now to find out why he deserves more than me. This is BS!
504,"I can’t believe she gets to take time that much time off for her kid. He isn’t even that sick. Hasn’t she ever heard of day care? She sent me an email asking for help, but I deleted it. If she asks me, I’m going to tell her I never got it. Sorry!
"
504,"I know you don’t think it’s fair that I’m taking time off, but I need your help covering my workload. Everyone else is telling me they’re too busy, and I know it’s a lot to ask, but can you help?"
504,Somebody put a bunch of medicine on Lorraine’s desk with a note that said take this and stop taking time off! She was so mad!
504,I don’t see why you can’t deal better with your illness. Everyone else in the department shouldn’t have to suffer because you are sick. Just take the whole leave time off so we can get a temp in here already! Why should we have to cover for you?
504,Here’s a website for people with your disease and it talks about how they can manage it WITHOUT taking time off work. Maybe you could get some tips from here?
505,"Hi Roger,
I don't appreciate a certain 505 making us look bad in front of people. I know how we can take care of business and make sure this guy pays for that mistake. Give me a call.
Ed"
505,"Hi Alex,
You need to understand that 505s are not appreciated around here. Don't think that any policies are going to protect you. It is not going to, and best keep your mouth shut
 Ned"
505,"Hi Joe, do not think that telling management or anyone else is going to help you. Nobody's going to protect you from what is going to happen next. You're making a horrible mistake.
Terry"
505,"Hi Tom,
If you think that telling other people is going to help you, you are wrong. Nobody likes a snitch. You better keep your head down and your mouth shut. Think of your career.
Mike"
505,"Listen up everybody,
If I find out who is discussing this project with the press, that person is going to be sorry.
Martin"
506,"Hi Tom,
That extra money isn't anything at all.
It's just nickels and dimes and not much more than that. I don't think it's extra compensation.
Frank"
506,"The little amount of money I got from the convention? I really don't think that is pay, do you? My feeling is not to report it.

Terry"
506," Hi Elliot, if you report that money you may find it text for income. Just keep it secret.
Tim"
506,"Hi Paul,
 I don't think there's any reason to be upset about that small amount. Just keep it. No one needs to know.

506,"Hi Ginger,
The change from that transaction isn't worth bothering about. Just keep it and think of it as a tip.
 Lenny"
507,"Hi Rachelle,
Honestly, I don't understand what you are upset about. It was just a small token of their appreciation. We can accept and no one will ever know.
Ann"
507,"Hi Sandy,
Please do accept the gift I gave you yesterday. We appreciate all you do for our company it is our way of showing thanks.
 Fernando"
507,"Hi John,
The way I look at it the fat cats in the company get 507 from clients. We should be able to do the same thing
Artie"
507,"Hi Marcy,
 I would not be upset about getting a gift from our clients. It is their small way of saying thanks to us. Stella"
507,"Hi Jim, you should give a little gift to your clients. It is a way of saying thanks and is expected.
Alan"
